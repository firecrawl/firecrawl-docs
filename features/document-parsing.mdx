Firecrawl provides powerful document parsing capabilities, allowing you to extract structured content from various document formats. This feature is particularly useful for processing files like spreadsheets, Word documents, and more.

## Supported Document Formats

Firecrawl currently supports the following document formats:

- **Excel Spreadsheets** (`.xlsx`, `.xls`)
  - Each worksheet is converted to an HTML table
  - Worksheets are separated by H2 headings with the sheet name
  - Preserves cell formatting and data types

- **Word Documents** (`.docx`, `.doc`, `.odt`, `.rtf`)
  - Extracts text content while preserving document structure
  - Maintains headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables
  - Preserves basic formatting and styling
  - Note: Legacy `.doc` files (Word 97-2003) use best-effort text extraction and may not preserve formatting

- **PDF Documents** (`.pdf`)
  - Extracts text content with layout information
  - Preserves document structure including sections and paragraphs
  - Handles both text-based and scanned PDFs (with OCR support)
  - Priced at 1 credit per-page. See [Pricing](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/pricing) for details.

## How to Use Document Parsing

Document parsing in Firecrawl works automatically when you provide a URL that points to a supported document type. The system will detect the file type based on the URL extension or content-type header and process it accordingly.

### Example: Scraping an Excel File

<ScrapeXLSX />

### Example: Scraping a Word Document

<ScrapeDocument />

## Output Format

All supported document types are converted to clean, structured markdown. For example, an Excel file with multiple sheets might be converted to:

```markdown
## Sheet1

| Name  | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Item 1 | 100   |
| Item 2 | 200   |

## Sheet2

| Date       | Description  |
|------------|--------------|
| 2023-01-01 | First quarter|
```
