Firecrawl's search API allows you to perform web searches and optionally scrape the search results in one operation.

- Choose specific output formats (markdown, HTML, links, screenshots)
- Search the web with customizable parameters (location, etc.)
- Optionally retrieve content from search results in various formats
- Control the number of results and set timeouts

For details, see the [Search Endpoint API Reference](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/endpoint/search).

  <InstallationNode />
</CodeGroup>

### Basic Usage

<CodeGroup>

  <SearchPython />

  <SearchNode />
  
  <SearchCURL />

</CodeGroup>

## Search result types

In addition to regular web results, Search supports specialized result types via the `sources` parameter:

- `web`: standard web results (default)
- `news`: news-focused results
- `images`: image search results

## Search Categories

Filter search results by specific categories using the `categories` parameter:

- `github`: Search within GitHub repositories, code, issues, and documentation
- `research`: Search academic and research websites (arXiv, Nature, IEEE, PubMed, etc.)
- `pdf`: Search for PDFs

### GitHub Category Search

Search specifically within GitHub repositories:

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "web scraping python",
    "categories": ["github"],
    "limit": 10
  }'
```

### Research Category Search

Search academic and research websites:

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "machine learning transformers",
    "categories": ["research"],
    "limit": 10
  }'
```

### Mixed Category Search

Combine multiple categories in one search:

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "neural networks",
    "categories": ["github", "research"],
    "limit": 15
  }'
```

### Category Response Format

Each search result includes a `category` field indicating its source:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "web": [
      {
        "url": "https://github.com/example/neural-network",
        "title": "Neural Network Implementation",
        "description": "A PyTorch implementation of neural networks",
        "category": "github"
      },
      {
        "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2024.12345",
        "title": "Advances in Neural Network Architecture",
        "description": "Research paper on neural network improvements",
        "category": "research"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Examples:

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "openai",
    "sources": ["news"],
    "limit": 5
  }'
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "jupiter",
    "sources": ["images"],
    "limit": 8
  }'
```

### HD Image Search with Size Filtering

Use Google Images operators to find high-resolution images:

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "sunset imagesize:1920x1080",
    "sources": ["images"],
    "limit": 5
  }'
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "mountain wallpaper larger:2560x1440",
    "sources": ["images"],
    "limit": 8
  }'
```

**Common HD resolutions:**
- `imagesize:1920x1080` - Full HD (1080p)
- `imagesize:2560x1440` - QHD (1440p)  
- `imagesize:3840x2160` - 4K UHD
- `larger:1920x1080` - HD and above
- `larger:2560x1440` - QHD and above

## Search with Content Scraping

Search and retrieve content from the search results in one operation.

<CodeGroup>

  <SearchContentPython />

  <SearchContentNode />
  
  <SearchContentCURL />

    }
  ]
}
```

## Advanced Search Options

Firecrawl's search API supports various parameters to customize your search:

### Location Customization

<CodeGroup>

  <SearchLocationPython />

  <SearchLocationNode />
  
  <SearchLocationCURL />

</CodeGroup>

### Time-Based Search

Use the `tbs` parameter to filter results by time:

<CodeGroup>

  <SearchTimePython />

  <SearchTimeNode />
  
  <SearchTimeCURL />

</CodeGroup>

Common `tbs` values:
- `qdr:h` - Past hour
- `qdr:d` - Past 24 hours
- `qdr:w` - Past week
- `qdr:m` - Past month
- `qdr:y` - Past year

For more precise time filtering, you can specify exact date ranges using the custom date range format:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from firecrawl import Firecrawl

# Initialize the client with your API key
firecrawl = Firecrawl(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")

# Search for results from December 2024
search_result = firecrawl.search(
    "firecrawl updates",
    limit=10,
    tbs="cdr:1,cd_min:12/1/2024,cd_max:12/31/2024"
)
```

```js JavaScript
import Firecrawl from '@mendable/firecrawl-js';

// Initialize the client with your API key
const firecrawl = new Firecrawl({apiKey: "fc-YOUR_API_KEY"});

// Search for results from December 2024
firecrawl.search("firecrawl updates", {
  limit: 10,
  tbs: "cdr:1,cd_min:12/1/2024,cd_max:12/31/2024"
})
.then(searchResult => {
  console.log(searchResult.data);
});
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "firecrawl updates",
    "limit": 10,
    "tbs": "cdr:1,cd_min:12/1/2024,cd_max:12/31/2024"
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

### Custom Timeout

Set a custom timeout for search operations:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp

# Initialize the client with your API key
app = FirecrawlApp(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")

# Set a 30-second timeout
search_result = app.search(
    "complex search query",
    limit=10,
    timeout=30000  # 30 seconds in milliseconds
)
```

```js JavaScript
import FirecrawlApp from '@mendable/firecrawl-js';

// Initialize the client with your API key
const app = new FirecrawlApp({apiKey: "fc-YOUR_API_KEY"});

// Set a 30-second timeout
app.search("complex search query", {
  limit: 10,
  timeout: 30000  // 30 seconds in milliseconds
})
.then(searchResult => {
  // Process results
  console.log(searchResult.data);
});
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "complex search query",
    "limit": 10,
    "timeout": 30000
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

## Cost Implications

The cost of using this endpoint is 2 credits per 10 search results (0.2 credits per search result). There is no additional charge for basic scrapes of each search result.

However, be aware of these cost factors:

- **PDF parsing**: 1 credit per PDF page (can significantly increase costs for multi-page PDFs)
- **Stealth proxy mode**: +4 additional credits per search result
- ***JSON mode***: +4 additional credits per search result

To control costs:
- Set `parsers: []` if you don't need PDF content
- Use `proxy: "basic"` instead of `"stealth"` when possible
- Limit the number of search results with the `limit` parameter

## Advanced Scraping Options

For more details about the scraping options, refer to the [Scrape Feature documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/features/scrape). Everything except for the FIRE-1 Agent and Change-Tracking features are supported by this Search endpoint.
