Firecrawl converts web pages into markdown, ideal for LLM applications.

- It manages complexities: proxies, caching, rate limits, js-blocked content
- Handles dynamic content: dynamic websites, js-rendered sites, PDFs, images
- Outputs clean markdown, structured data, screenshots or html.

For details, see the [Scrape Endpoint API Reference](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/endpoint/scrape).

## Scraping a URL with Firecrawl

### /scrape endpoint

Used to scrape a URL and get its content.

### Installation 

<CodeGroup>

  <InstallationPython />

  <InstallationNode />

  <InstallationCLI />

</CodeGroup>

### Usage

<CodeGroup>

  <ScrapePython />

  <ScrapeNode />

  <ScrapeCURL />

  <ScrapeCLI />

</CodeGroup>

For more details about the parameters, refer to the [API Reference](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/endpoint/scrape).

<Info>
  Each scrape consumes 1 credit. Additional credits apply for certain options: JSON mode costs 4 additional credits per page, enhanced proxy costs 4 additional credits per page, and PDF parsing costs 1 credit per PDF page.
</Info>

### Response

SDKs will return the data object directly. cURL will return the payload exactly as shown below.

<ScrapeResponse />

## Scrape Formats

You can now choose what formats you want your output in. You can specify multiple output formats. Supported formats are:

- Markdown (`markdown`)
- Summary (`summary`)
- HTML (`html`) - cleaned version of the page's HTML
- Raw HTML (`rawHtml`) - unmodified HTML as received from the page
- Screenshot (`screenshot`, with options like `fullPage`, `quality`, `viewport`)
- Links (`links`)
- JSON (`json`) - structured output
- Images (`images`) - extract all image URLs from the page
- Branding (`branding`) - extract brand identity and design system

Output keys will match the format you choose.

## Extract structured data

### /scrape (with json) endpoint

Used to extract structured data from scraped pages.

<CodeGroup>

<ExtractPython />
<ExtractNode />
<ExtractCURL />

</CodeGroup>

Output:

<ExtractOutput />

### Extracting without schema

You can now extract without a schema by just passing a `prompt` to the endpoint. The llm chooses the structure of the data.

<CodeGroup>


<ExtractNoSchemaPython />
<ExtractNoSchemaNode />
<ExtractNoSchemaCURL />

</CodeGroup>

Output:

<ExtractNoSchemaOutput />

### JSON format options

When using the `json` format, pass an object inside `formats` with the following parameters:

- `schema`: JSON Schema for the structured output.
- `prompt`: Optional prompt to help guide extraction when a schema is present or when you prefer light guidance.

## Extract brand identity

### /scrape (with branding) endpoint

The branding format extracts comprehensive brand identity information from a webpage, including colors, fonts, typography, spacing, UI components, and more. This is useful for design system analysis, brand monitoring, or building tools that need to understand a website's visual identity.

<CodeGroup>

<ScrapeBrandingPython />
<ScrapeBrandingNode />
<ScrapeBrandingCURL />

</CodeGroup>

### Response

The branding format returns a comprehensive `BrandingProfile` object with the following structure:

<ScrapeBrandingOutput />

### Branding Profile Structure

The `branding` object contains the following properties:

- `colorScheme`: The detected color scheme (`"light"` or `"dark"`)
- `logo`: URL of the primary logo
- `colors`: Object containing brand colors:
  - `primary`, `secondary`, `accent`: Main brand colors
  - `background`, `textPrimary`, `textSecondary`: UI colors
  - `link`, `success`, `warning`, `error`: Semantic colors
- `fonts`: Array of font families used on the page
- `typography`: Detailed typography information:
  - `fontFamilies`: Primary, heading, and code font families
  - `fontSizes`: Size definitions for headings and body text
  - `fontWeights`: Weight definitions (light, regular, medium, bold)
  - `lineHeights`: Line height values for different text types
- `spacing`: Spacing and layout information:
  - `baseUnit`: Base spacing unit in pixels
  - `borderRadius`: Default border radius
  - `padding`, `margins`: Spacing values
- `components`: UI component styles:
  - `buttonPrimary`, `buttonSecondary`: Button styles
  - `input`: Input field styles
- `icons`: Icon style information
- `images`: Brand images (logo, favicon, og:image)
- `animations`: Animation and transition settings
- `layout`: Layout configuration (grid, header/footer heights)
- `personality`: Brand personality traits (tone, energy, target audience)

### Combining with other formats

You can combine the branding format with other formats to get comprehensive page data:

<CodeGroup>

<ScrapeBrandingCombinedPython />
<ScrapeBrandingCombinedNode />
<ScrapeBrandingCombinedCURL />

</CodeGroup>

## Interacting with the page with Actions

Firecrawl allows you to perform various actions on a web page before scraping its content. This is particularly useful for interacting with dynamic content, navigating through pages, or accessing content that requires user interaction.

Here is an example of how to use actions to navigate to google.com, search for Firecrawl, click on the first result, and take a screenshot.

It is important to almost always use the `wait` action before/after executing other actions to give enough time for the page to load.

### Example
<CodeGroup>

<ScrapeActionsPython />
<ScrapeActionsNode /> 
<ScrapeActionsCURL />

</CodeGroup>
### Output

<CodeGroup>

<ScrapeActionsOutput />


</CodeGroup>
For more details about the actions parameters, refer to the [API Reference](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/endpoint/scrape).

## Location and Language

Specify country and preferred languages to get relevant content based on your target location and language preferences.

### How it works

When you specify the location settings, Firecrawl will use an appropriate proxy if available and emulate the corresponding language and timezone settings. By default, the location is set to 'US' if not specified.

### Usage

To use the location and language settings, include the `location` object in your request body with the following properties:

- `country`: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code (e.g., 'US', 'AU', 'DE', 'JP'). Defaults to 'US'.
- `languages`: An array of preferred languages and locales for the request in order of priority. Defaults to the language of the specified location.

<CodeGroup>
<ScrapeLocationPython />
<ScrapeLocationNode />
<ScrapeLocationCURL />
</CodeGroup>

For more details about supported locations, refer to the [Proxies documentation](/features/proxies).

## Caching and maxAge

To make requests faster, Firecrawl serves results from cache by default when a recent copy is available.

- **Default freshness window**: `maxAge = 172800000` ms (2 days). If a cached page is newer than this, it’s returned instantly; otherwise, the page is scraped and then cached.
- **Performance**: This can speed up scrapes by up to 5x when data doesn’t need to be ultra-fresh.
- **Always fetch fresh**: Set `maxAge` to `0`.
- **Avoid storing**: Set `storeInCache` to `false` if you don’t want Firecrawl to cache/store results for this request.
- **Change tracking**: Requests that include `changeTracking` bypass the cache, so `maxAge` is ignored.

Example (force fresh content):

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from firecrawl import Firecrawl
firecrawl = Firecrawl(api_key='fc-YOUR_API_KEY')

doc = firecrawl.scrape(url='https://example.com', maxAge=0, formats=['markdown'])
print(doc)
```

```js Node
import Firecrawl from '@mendable/firecrawl-js';

const firecrawl = new Firecrawl({ apiKey: "fc-YOUR-API-KEY" });

const doc = await firecrawl.scrape('https://example.com', { maxAge: 0, formats: ['markdown'] });
console.log(doc);
```

```bash cURL
curl -s -X POST "https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/scrape" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FIRECRAWL_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "maxAge": 0,
    "formats": ["markdown"]
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>
Example (use a 10-minute cache window):

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from firecrawl import Firecrawl
firecrawl = Firecrawl(api_key='fc-YOUR_API_KEY')

doc = firecrawl.scrape(url='https://example.com', maxAge=600000, formats=['markdown', 'html'])
print(doc)
```

```js Node

const firecrawl = new Firecrawl({ apiKey: "fc-YOUR-API-KEY" });

const doc = await firecrawl.scrape('https://example.com', { maxAge: 600000, formats: ['markdown', 'html'] });
console.log(doc);
```

```bash cURL
curl -s -X POST "https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/scrape" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FIRECRAWL_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "maxAge": 600000,
    "formats": ["markdown", "html"]
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

## Batch scraping multiple URLs

You can now batch scrape multiple URLs at the same time. It takes the starting URLs and optional parameters as arguments. The params argument allows you to specify additional options for the batch scrape job, such as the output formats.

### How it works

It is very similar to how the `/crawl` endpoint works. It submits a batch scrape job and returns a job ID to check the status of the batch scrape. 

The sdk provides 2 methods, synchronous and asynchronous. The synchronous method will return the results of the batch scrape job, while the asynchronous method will return a job ID that you can use to check the status of the batch scrape.

### Usage

<CodeGroup>

<BatchScrapePython />
<BatchScrapeNode />
<BatchScrapeCURL />

</CodeGroup>

### Response

If you’re using the sync methods from the SDKs, it will return the results of the batch scrape job. Otherwise, it will return a job ID that you can use to check the status of the batch scrape.

#### Synchronous

<BatchScrapeOutput />

#### Asynchronous

You can then use the job ID to check the status of the batch scrape by calling the `/batch/scrape/{id}` endpoint. This endpoint is meant to be used while the job is still running or right after it has completed **as batch scrape jobs expire after 24 hours**.

<BatchScrapeAsyncOutput />

## Enhanced Mode

For complex websites, Firecrawl offers enhanced mode that provides better success rates while maintaining privacy.
