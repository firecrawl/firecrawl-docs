## Batch scraping multiple URLs

You can now batch scrape multiple URLs at the same time. It takes the starting URLs and optional parameters as arguments. The params argument allows you to specify additional options for the batch scrape job, such as the output formats.

### How it works

It is very similar to how the `/crawl` endpoint works. You can either start the batch and wait for completion, or start it and handle completion yourself.

- `batchScrape` (JS) / `batch_scrape` (Python): starts a batch job and waits for it to complete, returning the results.
- `startBatchScrape` (JS) / `start_batch_scrape` (Python): starts a batch job and returns the job ID so you can poll or use webhooks.

### Usage

<CodeGroup>

<BatchScrapePython />
<BatchScrapeNode />
<BatchScrapeCURL />

</CodeGroup>

### Response

Calling `batchScrape`/`batch_scrape` returns the full results when the batch completes.

<BatchScrapeOutput />

Calling `startBatchScrape`/`start_batch_scrape` returns
a job ID you can track via `getBatchScrapeStatus`/`get_batch_scrape_status`, using
the API endpoint `/batch/scrape/{id}`, or webhooks. Job results are available via the API for 24 hours after completion. After this period, you can still view your batch scrape history and results in the [activity logs](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/logs).

## Batch scrape with structured extraction

You can also use the batch scrape endpoint to extract structured data from the pages. This is useful if you want to get the same structured data from a list of URLs.

<CodeGroup>

<BatchScrapeExtractPython />
<BatchScrapeExtractNode />
<BatchScrapeExtractCURL />

</CodeGroup>

### Response

`batchScrape`/`batch_scrape` returns full results:

<BatchScrapeExtractOutput />

`startBatchScrape`/`start_batch_scrape` returns a job ID:

<BatchScrapeExtractAsyncOutput />

## Batch scrape with webhooks

You can configure webhooks to receive real-time notifications as each URL in your batch is scraped. This allows you to process results immediately instead of waiting for the entire batch to complete.

<BatchScrapeWebhookCURL />

### Quick Reference

**Event Types:**

- `batch_scrape.started` - When the batch scrape begins
- `batch_scrape.page` - For each URL successfully scraped
- `batch_scrape.completed` - When all URLs are processed
- `batch_scrape.failed` - If the batch scrape encounters an error

**Basic Payload:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "type": "batch_scrape.page",
  "id": "batch-job-id",
  "data": [...], // Page data for 'page' events
  "metadata": {}, // Your custom metadata
  "error": null
}
```

### Security: Verifying Webhook Signatures

Every webhook request from Firecrawl includes an `X-Firecrawl-Signature` header containing an HMAC-SHA256 signature. **Always verify this signature** to ensure the webhook is authentic and hasn't been tampered with.

**How it works:**

1. Get your webhook secret from the [Advanced tab](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/settings?tab=advanced) of your account settings
2. Extract the signature from the `X-Firecrawl-Signature` header
3. Compute HMAC-SHA256 of the raw request body using your secret
4. Compare with the signature header using a timing-safe function

<Warning>
  Never process a webhook without verifying its signature first. The `X-Firecrawl-Signature` header contains the signature in the format: `sha256=abc123def456...`
</Warning>

For complete implementation examples in JavaScript and Python, see the [Webhook Security documentation](/webhooks/security).
