The `/agent` endpoint is the next evolution of our [`/extract`](/features/extract) endpoint. It uses AI agents to intelligently gather and structure data from across the web. Unlike `/extract`, Agent requires only a prompt and URLs are optional, making it incredibly flexible for a wide variety of use cases.

<Info>Agent is the successor to `/extract`: more reliable, faster, and cheaper.</Info>

Agent builds on everything great about `/extract` and takes it further:

- **No URLs Required**: Just describe what you need via `prompt` parameter. URLs are optional.
- **Deep Web Search**: Autonomously searches and navigates deep into sites to find your data
- **Reliable and Accurate**: Works with a wide variety of queries and use cases
- **Faster**: Processes multiple sources in parallel for quicker results
- **Cheaper**: Agent is more cost-effective than `/extract`

## Using `/agent`

The only required parameter is `prompt`. Simply describe what data you want to extract.

### Basic Usage (Prompt Only)

<CodeGroup>

<AgentPython />
<AgentJS />
<AgentCURL />

</CodeGroup>

### Response

<AgentOutput />


## With Schema

For structured output, provide a JSON schema. The SDKs support Pydantic (Python) and Zod (Node) for type-safe schema definitions:

<CodeGroup>

<AgentWithSchemaPython />
<AgentWithSchemaJS />
<AgentWithSchemaCURL />

</CodeGroup>

## With URLs (Optional)

You can optionally provide URLs to focus the agent on specific pages:

<CodeGroup>

<AgentWithURLsPython />
<AgentWithURLsJS />
<AgentWithURLsCURL />

</CodeGroup>

### Schema Response

<AgentWithSchemaOutput />

## Job Status and Completion

Agent jobs run asynchronously. When you submit a job, you'll receive a Job ID that you can use to check status:

- **Default method**: `agent()` waits and returns final results
- **Start then poll**: Use `start_agent` (Python) or `startAgent` (Node) to get a Job ID immediately, then poll with `get_agent_status` / `getAgentStatus`

<Note>Job results are available for 24 hours after completion.</Note>

<CodeGroup>

<AgentStatusPython />
<AgentStatusJS />
<AgentStatusCURL />

</CodeGroup>

### Possible States

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `processing` | The agent is still working on your request |
| `completed` | Extraction finished successfully |
| `failed` | An error occurred during extraction |

#### Pending Example

<AgentStatusPending />

#### Completed Example

<AgentStatusCompleted />

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `prompt` | string | **Yes** | Natural language description of the data you want to extract (max 10,000 characters) |
| `urls` | array | No | Optional list of URLs to focus the extraction |
| `schema` | object | No | Optional JSON schema for structured output |

## Agent vs Extract: What's Improved

| Feature | Agent (New) | Extract |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| URLs Required | No | Yes |
| Speed | Faster | Standard |
| Cost | Lower | Standard |
| Reliability | Higher | Standard |
| Query Flexibility | High | Moderate |

## Example Use Cases

- **Research**: "Find the top 5 AI startups and their funding amounts"
- **Competitive Analysis**: "Compare pricing plans between Slack and Microsoft Teams"
- **Data Gathering**: "Extract contact information from company websites"
- **Content Summarization**: "Summarize the latest blog posts about web scraping"
