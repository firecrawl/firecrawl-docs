Firecrawl provides different proxy types to help you scrape websites with varying levels of complexity. The proxy type can be specified using the `proxy` parameter.

### Proxy Types

Firecrawl supports three types of proxies:

- **basic**: Proxies for scraping most sites. Fast and usually works.
- **stealth**: Stealth proxies for scraping complex sites while maintaining privacy. Slower, but more reliable on certain sites.
- **auto**: Firecrawl will automatically retry scraping with stealth proxies if the basic proxy fails. If the retry with stealth is successful, 5 credits will be billed for the scrape. If the first attempt with basic is successful, only the regular cost will be billed.

If you do not specify a proxy, Firecrawl will default to auto.

### Using Stealth Mode

When scraping complex websites, you can use stealth mode to improve your success rate while maintaining privacy.

<CodeGroup>

<ProxyPython />

<ProxyNode />

<ProxyCURL />

</CodeGroup>

**Note:** Stealth proxy requests cost 5 credits per request when used.

## Using Stealth as a Retry Mechanism

A common pattern is to first try scraping with the default proxy settings, and then retry with stealth mode if you encounter specific error status codes (401, 403, or 500) in the `metadata.statusCode` field of the response. These status codes can be indicative of the website blocking your request.

<CodeGroup>

<ProxyRetryPython />

<ProxyRetryNode />

<ProxyRetryCURL />

</CodeGroup>

This approach allows you to optimize your credit usage by only using stealth mode when necessary.

## Limitations

Stealth mode improves success on sites with basic anti-bot detection, but **cannot bypass CAPTCHA challenges** including reCAPTCHA (v2, v3, Enterprise), hCaptcha, or similar verification systems. If a page requires manual CAPTCHA completion, the scrape will be blocked regardless of proxy or configuration settings.
