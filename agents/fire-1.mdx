FIRE-1 is an AI agent that enhances Firecrawl's scraping capabilities. It can controls browser actions and navigates complex website structures to enable comprehensive data extraction beyond traditional scraping methods.

### What FIRE-1 Can Do:
- Plan and take actions to uncover data
- Interact with buttons, links, inputs, and dynamic elements.
- Get multiple pages of data that require pagination, multiple steps, etc.

## How to use FIRE-1

You can leverage the FIRE-1 agent with the `/v1/extract` endpoint for complex extraction tasks that require navigation across multiple pages or interaction with elements.

**Example:**

<CodeGroup>

<ExtractFire1Python />
<ExtractFire1Node />
<ExtractFire1CURL />

</CodeGroup>

## Billing

The cost of using FIRE-1 is non-deterministic. See our [credit calculator](https://www.firecrawl.dev/extract-calculator) to learn about the base cost of each Extract request.

**Why is FIRE-1 more expensive?**  
  FIRE-1 leverages advanced browser automation and AI planning to interact with complex web pages, which requires more compute resources than standard extraction.

## Rate limits

* `/extract`: 10 requests per minute
