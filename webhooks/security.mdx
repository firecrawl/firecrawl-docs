Firecrawl signs every webhook request using HMAC-SHA256. Verifying signatures ensures requests are authentic and haven't been tampered with.

## Secret Key

Your webhook secret is available in the [Advanced tab](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/settings?tab=advanced) of your account settings. Each account has a unique secret used to sign all webhook requests.

<Warning>
  Keep your webhook secret secure and never expose it publicly. If you believe your secret has been compromised, regenerate it immediately from your account settings.
</Warning>

## Signature Verification

Each webhook request includes an `X-Firecrawl-Signature` header:

```
X-Firecrawl-Signature: sha256=abc123def456...
```

### How to Verify

1. Extract the signature from the `X-Firecrawl-Signature` header
2. Get the raw request body (before parsing)
3. Compute HMAC-SHA256 using your secret key
4. Compare signatures using a timing-safe function

## Best Practices

### Always Verify Signatures

Never process a webhook without verifying its signature first:

```javascript
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  if (!verifySignature(req)) {
    return res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
  }
  processWebhook(req.body);
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

### Use Timing-Safe Comparisons

Standard string comparison can leak timing information. Use `crypto.timingSafeEqual()` in Node.js or `hmac.compare_digest()` in Python.

### Use HTTPS

Always use HTTPS for your webhook endpoint to ensure payloads are encrypted in transit.
