Webhooks let you receive real-time notifications as your operations progress, instead of polling for status.

## Supported Operations

| Operation    | Events                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Crawl        | `started`, `page`, `completed`                          |
| Batch Scrape | `started`, `page`, `completed`                          |
| Extract      | `started`, `completed`, `failed`                        |
| Agent        | `started`, `action`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled` |

## Configuration

Add a `webhook` object to your request:

<WebhookConfigBasic />

| Field      | Type   | Required | Description                           |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `url`      | string | Yes      | Your endpoint URL (HTTPS)             |
| `headers`  | object | No       | Custom headers to include             |
| `metadata` | object | No       | Custom data included in payloads      |
| `events`   | array  | No       | Event types to receive (default: all) |

## Usage

### Crawl with Webhook

<CrawlWebhookCURL />

### Batch Scrape with Webhook

<BatchScrapeWebhookCURL />

## Timeouts & Retries

Your endpoint must respond with a `2xx` status within **10 seconds**.

If delivery fails (timeout, non-2xx, or network error), Firecrawl retries automatically:

| Retry | Delay after failure |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| 1st   | 1 minute            |
| 2nd   | 5 minutes           |
| 3rd   | 15 minutes          |

After 3 failed retries, the webhook is marked as failed and no further attempts are made.
