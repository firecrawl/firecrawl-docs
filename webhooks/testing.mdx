This page covers tools and techniques for testing webhook integrations during development and debugging issues in production.

## Local Development

### Exposing Local Servers

Since webhooks need to reach your server from the internet, you'll need to expose your local development server publicly.

#### Using Cloudflare Tunnels

[Cloudflare Tunnels](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases) provide a free way to securely expose your local development server to the internet without requiring account registration or opening firewall ports:
1. Download cloudflared from GitHub releases or use a package manager
2. Expose your local server, by doing:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url localhost:3000

# Example output:
# Your quick Tunnel has been created! Visit it at (it may take some time to be reachable):
# https://abc123.trycloudflare.com
```

3. Use the provided URL in your webhook configuration:

```json
{
  "url": "https://abc123.trycloudflare.com/webhook"
}
```

#### Using Beeceptor CLI for local tunneling

[Beeceptor CLI](https://beeceptor.com/local-tunnel/) is a tool that lets you quickly create a free public endpoint with local tunneling support for testing webhooks. You can inspect payloads, add custom response rules, and simulate delays or errors to test real-world API behavior on webhooks.
1. Visit https://beeceptor.com/local-tunnel/ in your browser, and download beeceptor-cli.
2. Create a local tunnel, by doing:
```bash
beeceptor-cli -p 3030

# Example output:
# ? Select a Beeceptor endpoint below: (Use arrow keys)
# ❯ Create a new endpoint (Free, no credit-card or sign-up required). 
#   Register an existing endpoint. 
```
When prompted, select **"Create a new endpoint"** and hit enter.

3. A unique, public HTTPS endpoint will be automatically created, and the CLI will display two key URLs:
```bash
[2025-10-31T11:42:14.111Z] Now tunneling requests from https://qt46d0fd07809895ecab3acda7f3.free.beeceptor.com to http://127.0.0.1:3030.
[2025-10-31T11:42:14.111Z] Dashboard: https://app.beeceptor.com/console/qt46d0fd07809895ecab3acda7f3
```
The first URL, is your **webhook endpoint URL**. This is the address you'll use to receive and test webhooks, and it tunnels requests directly to your local application on port 3030.
The second URL is your dashboard where you can inspect payloads, add custom response rules, and simulate faults for testing.

4. Use the provided webhook endpoint URL in your webhook configuration:
```json
{
  "url": "https://qt46d0fd07809895ecab3acda7f3.free.beeceptor.com"
}
```

## Webhook Payload Inspection

### Using Cloud-Hosted Endpoints

You can inspect webhooks instantly without deploying a server or setting up local tunneling. Specialized cloud services like Webhook.site provide a zero-setup, public URL to capture and inspect all incoming HTTP request payloads, ideal for quick debugging and payload inspection.

#### Using Webhook.site

[Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) provides a unique, random public URL endpoint instantly upon visiting the page, requiring no sign-ups, and enabling immediate testing. It offers a host of powerful custom actions, and is also capable of local tunneling:
1. Visit https://webhook.site/ in your browser.
2. Copy the auto-generated URL displayed on the page. This will be your webhook endpoint URL.

**Example:**
```bash
https://webhook.site/e0516009-a024-402b-bdf8-4320ea903efa
```

3. Use the provided URL in your webhook configuration:
```json
{
  "url": "https://webhook.site/e0516009-a024-402b-bdf8-4320ea903efa"
}
```

## Debugging Common Issues

### Webhooks Not Arriving

1. **Check URL accessibility**: Ensure your endpoint is publicly accessible by Firecrawl.
2. **Verify HTTPS**: Webhook URLs must use HTTPS. Firecrawl, will reject non-secure HTTP endpoints.
3. **Check firewall settings**: Allow incoming connections to your webhook port.
4. **Review event filters**: Ensure you're subscribed to the correct event types.

### Signature Verification Failing

1. **Check the secret key**: Ensure you are using the correct webhook Secret key, found in your Firecrawl account settings (under the Advanced tab)
2. **Verify raw body usage**: Make sure you're using the raw request body, and not a parsed object:

```javascript
// ❌ Wrong - using parsed body
const signature = crypto
  .createHmac('sha256', secret)
  .update(JSON.stringify(req.body))
  .digest('hex');

// ✅ Correct - using raw body
app.use('/webhook', express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }));
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const signature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(req.body) // Raw buffer
    .digest('hex');
});
```

3. **Ensure the hashing algorithm and encoding match**:
   - Header Name: Firecrawl sends the signature in the `X-Firecrawl-Signature` HTTP header.
   - Header Format: The value is prefixed with the algorithm: `sha256=<hash>`. Split from `=` to obtain the hash.

4. **Ensure the encoding is valid**: The Firecrawl signature is calculated using HMAC-SHA256 and the output hash is encoded as a hexadecimal string. Ensure your comparison hash is also a hexadecimal string.
