## Accessing Account Settings

You can access your account settings at [https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/settings](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/settings).

## Billing Information

Your billing information is managed through Stripe and can be viewed in the **Billing** tab of your account settings.

### Important: Billing Access Restrictions

**Only the email address linked to your Stripe account can view billing details.** This is a security measure by design - team admins and other team members will not see billing information even if they have admin privileges.

If you see blank billing information, it likely means you're logged in with a different email address than the one connected to Stripe.

### Managing Multiple Team Members and Billing

If multiple team members need to manage billing:

1. **Identify the Stripe email**: Determine which email address is currently linked to your Stripe account
2. **Transfer access (if needed)**: Contact our support team to update the Stripe account email if you need to change who manages billing
3. **Update payment methods**: Only the team member with the Stripe-linked email can update payment methods and billing details directly in Stripe

### Updating Billing Information

To update your billing information:

1. Go to [Account Settings > Billing](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/settings?tab=billing)
2. Click "Manage Subscriptions"
3. You'll be directed to Stripe where you can update payment methods and billing details
4. Only the email linked to Stripe can make these changes

### Invoices

If you need invoices or billing statements, contact our support team at [help@firecrawl.com](mailto:help@firecrawl.com).

## API Keys and Advanced Settings

Your API keys and webhook secrets are available in the [Advanced tab](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/settings?tab=advanced) of your account settings.

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys and webhook secrets secure. Never commit them to version control or expose them publicly.
</Warning>

## Team Management

Teams allow multiple users to collaborate on Firecrawl projects. Each team member can have different roles and permissions based on your subscription plan.

For more information about managing team members, contact [help@firecrawl.com](mailto:help@firecrawl.com).
