Add web scraping and search capabilities to Claude Code with Firecrawl MCP.

## Quick Setup

### 1. Get Your API Key
Sign up at [firecrawl.dev/app](https://firecrawl.dev/app) and copy your API key.

### 2. Add Firecrawl MCP Server

```bash
claude mcp add firecrawl -e FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-api-key -- npx -y firecrawl-mcp
```

Replace `your-api-key` with your actual Firecrawl API key.

Done! You can now search and scrape the web from Claude Code.

## Quick Demo

Try these in Claude Code:

**Search the web:**
```
Search for the latest Next.js 15 features
```

**Scrape a page:**
```
Scrape firecrawl.dev and tell me what it does
```

**Get documentation:**
```
Find and scrape the Stripe API docs for payment intents
```

Claude will automatically use Firecrawl's search and scrape tools to get the information.
