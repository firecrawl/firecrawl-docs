Add web scraping and search capabilities to Cursor with Firecrawl MCP.

## Quick Setup

### 1. Get Your API Key
Sign up at [firecrawl.dev/app](https://firecrawl.dev/app) and copy your API key.

### 2. Add to Cursor

Open Settings (`Cmd+,`), search for "MCP", and add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "firecrawl": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "firecrawl-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual Firecrawl API key.

### 3. Restart Cursor

Done! You can now search and scrape the web from Cursor.

## Quick Demo

Try these in Cursor Chat (`Cmd+K`):

**Search:**
```
Search for TypeScript best practices 2025
```

**Scrape:**
```
Scrape firecrawl.dev and tell me what it does
```

**Get docs:**
```
Scrape the React hooks documentation and explain useEffect
```

Cursor will automatically use Firecrawl tools.
