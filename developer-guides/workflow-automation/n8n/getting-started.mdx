## Introduction to Firecrawl and n8n

Web scraping automation has become essential for modern businesses. Whether you need to monitor competitor prices, aggregate content, generate leads, or power AI applications with real-time data, the combination of Firecrawl and n8n provides a powerful solution without requiring programming knowledge.

![Firecrawl and n8n integration](/images/guides/n8n/firecrawl-n8n-integration-hero.png)

**What is n8n?**

n8n is an open-source workflow automation platform that connects different tools and services together. Think of it as a visual programming environment where you drag and drop nodes onto a canvas, connect them, and create automated workflows. With over 400 integrations, n8n lets you build complex automations without writing code.

## Why Use Firecrawl with n8n?

Traditional web scraping presents several challenges. Custom scripts break when websites update their structure. Anti-bot systems block automated requests. JavaScript-heavy sites don't render properly. Infrastructure requires constant maintenance.

Firecrawl handles these technical complexities on the scraping side, while n8n provides the automation framework. Together, they let you build production-ready workflows that:

- Extract data from any website reliably
- Connect scraped data to other business tools
- Run on schedules or triggered by events
- Scale from simple tasks to complex pipelines

This guide will walk you through setting up both platforms and building your first scraping workflow from scratch.

## Step 1: Create Your Firecrawl Account

Firecrawl provides the web scraping capabilities for your workflows. Let's set up your account and get your API credentials.

### Sign Up for Firecrawl

1. Navigate to [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev?utm_source=firecrawl&utm_medium=documentation&utm_campaign=n8n-getting-started) in your web browser
2. Click the "Get Started" or "Sign Up" button
3. Create an account using your email address or GitHub login
4. Verify your email if prompted

### Get Your API Key

After signing in, you need an API key to connect Firecrawl to n8n:

1. Go to your Firecrawl dashboard
2. Navigate to the [API Keys page](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys?utm_source=firecrawl&utm_medium=documentation&utm_campaign=n8n-getting-started)
3. Click "Create New API Key"
4. Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "n8n Integration")
5. Copy the generated API key and save it somewhere secure

![Firecrawl api key section](/images/guides/n8n/firecrawl-api-key-creation-dashboard.gif)

<Note>
Your API key is like a password. Keep it secure and never share it publicly. You'll need this key in the next section.
</Note>

Firecrawl provides free credits when you sign up, which is enough to test your workflows and complete this tutorial.

## Step 2: Set Up n8n

n8n offers two deployment options: cloud-hosted or self-hosted. For beginners, the cloud version is the fastest way to get started.

### Choose Your n8n Version

**n8n Cloud (Recommended for beginners):**
- No installation required
- Free tier available
- Managed infrastructure
- Automatic updates

**Self-Hosted:**
- Complete data control
- Run on your own servers
- Requires Docker installation
- Good for advanced users with specific security requirements

Choose the option that fits your needs. Both paths will lead you to the same workflow editor interface.

### Option A: n8n Cloud (Recommended for Beginners)

1. Visit [n8n.cloud](https://n8n.cloud?utm_source=firecrawl&utm_medium=documentation&utm_campaign=n8n-getting-started)
2. Click "Start Free" or "Sign Up"
3. Register using your email address or GitHub
4. Complete the verification process
5. You'll be directed to your n8n dashboard

![n8n Cloud homepage showing the signup options](/images/guides/n8n/n8n-cloud-signup-homepage.png)

The free tier provides everything you need to build and test workflows. You can upgrade later if you need more execution time or advanced features.

### Option B: Self-Hosted with Docker

If you prefer to run n8n on your own infrastructure, you can set it up quickly using Docker.

**Prerequisites:**
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/?utm_source=firecrawl&utm_medium=documentation&utm_campaign=n8n-getting-started) installed on your computer
- Basic familiarity with command line/terminal

**Installation Steps:**

1. Open your terminal or command prompt
2. Create a Docker volume to persist your workflow data:

```bash
docker volume create n8n_data
```

This volume stores your workflows, credentials, and execution history so they persist even if you restart the container.

3. Run the n8n Docker container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

![Terminal showing the docker commands being executed with n8n starting up](/images/guides/n8n/n8n-docker-self-hosted-installation.gif)

4. Wait for n8n to start. You'll see output indicating the server is running
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5678`
6. Create your n8n account by registering with an email

![n8n self-hosted welcome screen at localhost:5678](/images/guides/n8n/n8n-localhost-registration-form.gif)

Your self-hosted n8n instance is now running locally. The interface is identical to n8n Cloud, so you can follow the rest of this guide regardless of which option you chose.

<Note>
The `--rm` flag automatically removes the container when you stop it, but your data remains safe in the `n8n_data` volume. For production deployments, see the [n8n self-hosting documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/?utm_source=firecrawl&utm_medium=documentation&utm_campaign=n8n-getting-started) for more advanced configuration options.
</Note>

### Understanding the n8n Interface

When you first log in to n8n, you'll see the main dashboard:

![n8n dashboard showing the workflow list view with "Create new workflow" button](/images/guides/n8n/n8n-dashboard-workflow-list.png)

Key interface elements:

- **Workflows**: Your saved automations appear here
- **Executions**: History of workflow runs
- **Credentials**: Stored API keys and authentication tokens
- **Settings**: Account and workspace configuration

Click "Create New Workflow" to open the workflow editor.

### The Workflow Canvas

The workflow editor is where you'll build your automations:

![Empty n8n workflow canvas with the "+" button visible in the center](/images/guides/n8n/n8n-empty-workflow-canvas.png)

Important elements:

- **Canvas**: The main area where you place and connect nodes
- **Add Node Button (+)**: Click this to add new nodes to your workflow
- **Node Panel**: Opens when you click "+" showing all available nodes
- **Execute Workflow**: Runs your workflow manually for testing
- **Save**: Saves your workflow configuration

Let's build your first workflow by adding the Firecrawl node.

## Step 3: Install and Configure the Firecrawl Node

n8n includes native support for Firecrawl. You'll install the node and connect it to your Firecrawl account using the API key you created earlier.

### Add the Firecrawl Node to Your Workflow

1. In your new workflow canvas, click the "**+**" button in the center
2. The node selection panel opens on the right side
3. In the search box at the top, type "**Firecrawl**"
4. You'll see the Firecrawl node appear in the search results

![Clicking the + button, typing "Firecrawl" in the search, and the Firecrawl node appearing](/images/guides/n8n/n8n-search-install-firecrawl-node.gif)

5. Click "**Install**" next to the Firecrawl node
6. Wait for the installation to complete (this takes a few seconds)
7. Once installed, click on the Firecrawl node to add it to your canvas

![Firecrawl node now added to the canvas, showing as a box with the Firecrawl logo](/images/guides/n8n/n8n-firecrawl-node-added-canvas.gif)

The Firecrawl node will appear on your canvas as a box with the Firecrawl logo. This node represents a single Firecrawl operation in your workflow.

### Connect Your Firecrawl API Key

Before you can use the Firecrawl node, you need to authenticate it with your API key:

1. Click on the Firecrawl node box to open its configuration panel on the right
2. At the top, you'll see a "Credential to connect with" dropdown
3. Since this is your first time, click "**Create New Credential**"

![Firecrawl node configuration panel showing the credentials dropdown with "Create New Credential" option](/images/guides/n8n/n8n-firecrawl-api-credentials-setup.gif)

4. A credential configuration window opens
5. Enter a name for this credential (e.g., "My Firecrawl Account")
6. Paste your Firecrawl API key in the "API Key" field
7. Click "**Save**" at the bottom

The credential is now saved in n8n. You won't need to enter your API key again for future Firecrawl nodes.

### Test Your Connection

Let's verify that your Firecrawl node is properly connected:

1. With the Firecrawl node still selected, look at the configuration panel
2. In the "Resource" dropdown, select "**Scrape a url and get its content**"
3. In the "URL" field, enter: `https://example.com`
4. Leave other settings at their defaults for now
5. Click the "**Test step**" button at the bottom right of the node

![Selecting Scrape operation, entering example.com URL, and clicking Test step button](/images/guides/n8n/n8n-firecrawl-test-connection-scrape.gif)

If everything is configured correctly, you'll see the scraped content from example.com appear in the output panel below the node.

Congratulations! Your Firecrawl node is now connected and working.

## Step 4: Create Your Telegram Bot

Before building your first workflow, you'll need a Telegram bot to receive notifications. Telegram bots are free and easy to create through Telegram's BotFather.

### Create a Bot with BotFather

1. Open Telegram on your phone or desktop
2. Search for "**@BotFather**" (the official bot from Telegram)
3. Start a conversation with BotFather by clicking "**Start**"
4. Send the command `/newbot` to create a new bot
5. BotFather will ask you to choose a name for your bot (this is the display name users will see)
6. Enter a name like "**My Firecrawl Bot**"
7. Next, choose a username for your bot. It must end with "bot" (e.g., "**my_firecrawl_updates_bot**")
8. If the username is available, BotFather will create your bot and send you a message with your bot token

![Creating a bot with BotFather, showing the full conversation flow](/images/guides/n8n/telegram-botfather-create-new-bot.png)

<Note>
Save your bot token securely. This token is like a password that allows n8n to send messages as your bot. Never share it publicly.
</Note>

### Get Your Chat ID

To send messages to yourself, you need your Telegram chat ID:

1. Open your web browser and visit this URL (replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN` with your actual bot token):
   ```
   https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_BOT_TOKEN/getUpdates
   ```
2. Keep this browser tab open
3. Now, search for your bot's username in Telegram (the one you just created)
4. Start a conversation with your bot by clicking "**Start**"
5. Send any message to your bot (e.g., "hello")
6. Go back to the browser tab and refresh the page
7. Look for the `"chat":{"id":` field in the JSON response
8. The number next to `"id":` is your chat ID (e.g., `123456789`)
9. Save this chat ID for later

![Browser showing Telegram API getUpdates response with chat ID highlighted](/images/guides/n8n/telegram-api-get-chat-id-browser.gif)

<Note>
Your chat ID is the unique identifier for your conversation with the bot. You'll use this to tell n8n where to send messages.
</Note>

You now have everything needed to integrate Telegram with your n8n workflows.

## Step 5: Build Practical Workflows with Telegram

Now let's build three real-world workflows that send information directly to your Telegram. These examples demonstrate different Firecrawl operations and how to integrate them with Telegram notifications.

### Example 1: Daily Firecrawl Product Updates Summary

Get a daily summary of Firecrawl product updates delivered to your Telegram every morning.

**What you'll build:**
- Scrapes Firecrawl's product updates blog at 9 AM daily
- Uses AI to generate a summary of the content
- Sends the summary to your Telegram

**Step-by-step:**

1. Create a new workflow in n8n
2. Add a **Schedule Trigger** node:
   - Click the "**+**" button on canvas
   - Search for "**Schedule Trigger**"
   - Configure: Every day at 9:00 AM

![Schedule Trigger configured for daily 9 AM execution](/images/guides/n8n/n8n-schedule-trigger-daily-cron.gif)

3. Add the **Firecrawl** node:
   - Click "**+**" next to Schedule Trigger
   - Search for and add "**Firecrawl**"
   - Select your Firecrawl credential
   - Configure:
     - **Resource**: Scrape a url and get its content
     - **URL**: `https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/category/product-updates`
     - **Formats**: Select "Summary"

![Adding and configuring Firecrawl node with the blog URL and Summary format selected](/images/guides/n8n/n8n-firecrawl-scrape-blog-summary.gif)

4. Add the **Telegram** node:
   - Click "**+**" next to Firecrawl
   - Search for "**Telegram**"
   - Click "**Send a text message**" to add it to the canvas

5. Set up Telegram credentials:
   - Click on the Telegram node to open its configuration
   - In the "Credential to connect with" dropdown, click "**Create New Credential**"
   - Paste your bot token from BotFather
   - Click "**Save**"

![Telegram credential configuration with bot token field](/images/guides/n8n/n8n-telegram-bot-token-credentials.gif)

6. Configure the Telegram message:
   - **Operation**: Send Message
   - **Chat ID**: Enter your chat ID
   - **Text**: Leave this with a "hello" message for now

   - Click **Execute step** to test sending a message while receiving the summary from Firecrawl.

![Configuring Telegram node and mapping the summary field to the message text](/images/guides/n8n/n8n-test-telegram-message-firecrawl.gif)

   - Now with Firecrawl's summary structure, add the summary to the message text by dragging the `summary` field from Firecrawl node output.


7. Test the workflow:
   - Click "**Execute Workflow**"
   - Check your Telegram for the summary message

![Complete workflow showing Schedule Trigger → Firecrawl → Telegram with all nodes connected](/images/guides/n8n/n8n-workflow-complete-firecrawl-telegram.png)

8. Activate the workflow by toggling the "**Active**" switch

Your Telegram bot will now send you a daily summary of Firecrawl product updates every morning at 9 AM.

### Example 2: AI News Search to Telegram

This workflow uses Firecrawl's Search operation to find AI news and send formatted results to Telegram.

**Key differences from Example 1:**
- Uses a **Manual Trigger** instead of Schedule (run on demand)
- Uses **Search** operation instead of Scrape
- Includes a **Code** node to format multiple results

**Build the workflow:**

1. Create a new workflow and add a **Manual Trigger** node

2. Add **Firecrawl** node with these settings:
   - **Resource**: Search and optionally scrape search results
   - **Query**: `ai news`
   - **Limit**: 5

![Firecrawl Search node configuration with "ai news" query](/images/guides/n8n/n8n-firecrawl-search-ai-news-results.gif)

3. Add a **Code** node to format the search results:
   - Select "Run Once for All Items"
   - Paste this code:

```javascript
const results = $input.all();
let message = "Latest AI News:\n\n";

results.forEach((item) => {
  const webData = item.json.data.web;
  webData.forEach((article, index) => {
    message += `${index + 1}. ${article.title}\n`;
    message += `${article.description}\n`;
    message += `${article.url}\n\n`;
  });
});

return [{ json: { message } }];
```

![Adding Code node and pasting the formatting script](/images/guides/n8n/n8n-code-node-format-news-articles.gif)

4. Update **Telegram** node (using your saved credential):
   - **Text**: Drag the `message` field from Code node

![Complete workflow execution with AI news sent to Telegram](/images/guides/n8n/n8n-execute-workflow-telegram-delivery.gif)

<Tip>
Replace the Manual Trigger with a Schedule Trigger to get automatic AI news updates at set intervals.
</Tip>

### Example 3: AI-Powered News Summary

This workflow adds AI to Example 2, using OpenAI to generate intelligent summaries of the latest AI news before sending to Telegram.

**Key changes from Example 2:**
- Add **OpenAI credentials** setup
- Add **AI Agent** node between Code and Telegram
- AI Agent analyzes and summarizes all the news articles intelligently
- Telegram receives the AI-generated summary instead of raw news list

**Modify the workflow:**

1. **Get your OpenAI API key**:
   - Go to [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys?utm_source=firecrawl&utm_medium=documentation&utm_campaign=n8n-getting-started)
   - Sign in or create an account
   - Click "**Create new secret key**"
   - Give it a name (e.g., "n8n Integration")
   - Copy the API key immediately (you won't see it again)

![OpenAI dashboard showing API key creation](/images/guides/n8n/openai-api-key-creation-dashboard.gif)

2. **Add and connect the AI Agent node**:
   - Click "**+**" after the Code node
   - Search for "**Basic LLM Chain**" or "**AI Agent**"
   - Drag the `message` field from the Code node to the AI Agent's input prompt field
   - Select **OpenAI** as the LLM provider

![Adding AI Agent node, dragging input from Code node, and connecting OpenAI as LLM](/images/guides/n8n/n8n-ai-agent-openai-llm-setup.gif)

3. **Add your OpenAI credentials**:
   - Click "**Create New Credential**" for OpenAI
   - Paste your OpenAI API key
   - Select model: **gpt-5-mini** (cost-effective) or **gpt-5** (more capable)
   - Click "**Save**"

![Adding OpenAI credentials to the AI Agent node](/images/guides/n8n/n8n-openai-credentials-gpt-model.gif)

4. **Add the system prompt to the AI Agent**:
   - In the AI Agent node, add this system prompt:

```
You are an AI news analyst. Analyze the provided AI news articles and create a concise,
insightful summary highlighting the most important developments and trends.
Group related topics together and provide context about why these developments matter.
Keep the summary conversational and engaging, around 3-4 paragraphs.
```

![Adding the system prompt to the AI Agent node](/images/guides/n8n/n8n-ai-agent-system-prompt-configuration.gif)

5. **Update the Telegram node and test**:
   - Update the Telegram node:
     - **Text**: Drag the AI Agent's output (the generated summary)
     - Remove the old mapping to the Code node's message
   - Click "**Execute Workflow**" to test
   - The AI will analyze all news articles and create a summary
   - Check your Telegram for the AI-generated summary

![Complete workflow execution with AI-generated summary sent to Telegram](/images/guides/n8n/n8n-ai-summary-telegram-workflow-execution.gif)

<Note>
The AI Agent receives all the formatted news articles and creates an intelligent summary, making it easier to understand trends and important developments at a glance.
</Note>
