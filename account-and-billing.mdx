## Overview

This guide covers account management, billing, and team administration for Firecrawl.

## Accessing Your Account Settings

To manage your account and billing information:

1. Log in to your [Firecrawl dashboard](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app)
2. Navigate to **Settings** in the left sidebar
3. Select the **Billing** tab to manage your subscription and payment method

## Billing Information & Stripe Integration

Firecrawl uses **Stripe** to manage subscriptions and payments. Your billing information is stored and managed through Stripe.

### Important: Billing Access Restrictions

**Only the email address associated with your Stripe account can view and manage billing information.** This means:

- If user **A** initially set up the Stripe account, only user A can view billing details, payment methods, and subscription information
- Other team members with admin access **cannot** view billing details, even if they have team admin permissions
- To give another team member access to billing, you must transfer the Stripe account to their email address

### Viewing & Managing Your Billing Information

If you have access to the Stripe account (your email is the billing contact):

1. Go to **Settings > Billing**
2. Click **"Manage Subscriptions"** to access your Stripe portal
3. In the Stripe portal, you can:
   - View your current plan and pricing
   - Update your payment method
   - Download invoices
   - Manage subscription settings

### If You Can't See Billing Information

If you're a team admin but don't see billing details, it means the billing contact email is different from your account email. Contact the original account owner or email [help@firecrawl.com](mailto:help@firecrawl.com) to:

- Transfer the Stripe account to your email
- Download invoices for your records

## Team Management

Teams allow multiple users to access the same Firecrawl account and share API keys and credits.

### Current Plan Includes

- Up to **20 team seats** on all paid plans
- Free plans include limited team functionality

### Billing Responsibility

When managing team billing:

- Only the billing contact can view payment methods and billing history
- All team members share the same credit pool and usage limits
- Changing the billing contact transfers Stripe account access to a new email address

## Invoices and Payment History

To access invoices and payment history:

1. Open **Settings > Billing**
2. Click **"Manage Subscriptions"**
3. In the Stripe portal, navigate to the **Invoices** section

If you can't access the Stripe portal, request an invoice from [help@firecrawl.com](mailto:help@firecrawl.com).

## Payment Methods

Payment methods are managed exclusively through Stripe and cannot be viewed or updated through the Firecrawl dashboard by non-billing contacts. To update your payment method:

1. Go to **Settings > Billing**
2. Click **"Manage Subscriptions"**
3. Update your card information in the Stripe portal

<Info>
For security reasons, payment method details are only accessible through Stripe. The Firecrawl team does not have access to your payment information.
