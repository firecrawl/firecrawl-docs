# API literals must survive translation. Run from the repository root:
#
#   sh scripts/check-locale-api-literals.sh
#
# .github/workflows/checks.yml runs this on every pull request. Run it locally
# too before a change to the localized trees, and after every translation sync.
#
# For every localized .mdx that has an English counterpart, this compares the
# identifiers the two pages use:
#   1. missing API literal: the English page uses an API identifier inside a
#      code fence and the localized page has dropped it from its code.
#   2. translated API literal: the localized page uses an identifier-shaped
#      token that no English page uses anywhere, in code or in prose.
# Rule 1 draws its vocabulary from the OpenAPI specs, so it follows the API
# instead of a hand-written list. Rule 2 needs no vocabulary: an identifier
# that exists only in a translated tree was written by a translation pass.
#
# Rule 2 covers prose as well as code because a translated identifier reads the
# same either way: `changeTracking` rendered as `suiviDesModifications` in a
# sentence still tells the reader to pass a format name the API will reject.
# Prose costs no false positives here: the token still has to be camelCase or
# dotted, at least five characters, and absent from every English page, which
# no ordinary Spanish, French, Japanese, Portuguese, or Chinese word is. The
# one shape that is not an identifier is a localized filename such as
# `destino.mdx`, so tokens ending in a file extension or a bare TLD are
# skipped.
