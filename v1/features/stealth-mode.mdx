Firecrawl provides different proxy types to help you scrape websites with varying levels of complexity. The proxy type can be specified using the `proxy` parameter.

### Proxy Types

Firecrawl supports three types of proxies:

- **basic**: Proxies for scraping most sites. Fast and usually works.
- **stealth**: Enhanced proxies for scraping complex sites while maintaining privacy. Slower, but more reliable on certain sites.
- **auto**: Firecrawl will automatically retry scraping with stealth proxies if the basic proxy fails. If the retry with stealth is successful, 5 credits will be billed for the scrape. If the first attempt with basic is successful, only the regular cost will be billed.

If you do not specify a proxy, Firecrawl will default to basic.

### Using Enhanced Mode

When scraping complex websites, you can use stealth mode to improve your success rate while maintaining privacy.

**Note:** Starting May 8th, stealth proxy requests cost 5 credits per request.

## Using Enhanced as a Retry Mechanism

A common pattern is to first try scraping with the default proxy settings, and then retry with stealth mode if you encounter specific error status codes (401, 403, or 500) in the `metadata.statusCode` field of the response. These status codes can be indicative of the website blocking your request.

<ProxyRetryNode />

<ProxyRetryCURL />

This approach allows you to optimize your credit usage by only using stealth mode when necessary.
