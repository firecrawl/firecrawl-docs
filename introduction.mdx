## Welcome to Firecrawl

[Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev?ref=github) is an API service that takes a URL, crawls it, and converts it into clean markdown. We crawl all accessible subpages and give you clean markdown for each. No sitemap required.

## How to use it?

We provide an easy to use API with our hosted version. You can find the playground and documentation [here](https://firecrawl.dev/playground). You can also self host the backend if you'd like.

Check out the following resources to get started:
- **API**: [Documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/introduction)
- **SDKs**: [Python](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/sdks/python), [Node](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/sdks/node)
- **LLM Frameworks**: [Langchain (python)](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/firecrawl/), [Langchain (js)](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/web_loaders/firecrawl), [Llama Index](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/data_connectors/WebPageDemo/#using-firecrawl-reader), [Crew.ai](https://docs.crewai.com/), [Composio](https://composio.dev/tools/firecrawl/all), [PraisonAI](https://docs.praison.ai/firecrawl/), [Superinterface](https://superinterface.ai/docs/assistants/functions/firecrawl), [Vectorize](https://docs.vectorize.io/integrations/source-connectors/firecrawl)
- **Low-code Frameworks**: [Dify](https://dify.ai/blog/dify-ai-blog-integrated-with-firecrawl), [Langflow](https://docs.langflow.org/), [Flowise AI](https://docs.flowiseai.com/integrations/langchain/document-loaders/firecrawl), [Cargo](https://docs.getcargo.io/integration/firecrawl), [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/apps/firecrawl/)
- **Community SDKs**: [Go](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/sdks/go), [Rust](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/sdks/rust) (v1)
- **Others**: [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/firecrawl/integrations), [Pabbly Connect](https://www.pabbly.com/connect/integrations/firecrawl/)
- **Self-host:** To self-host refer to guide [here](/contributing/self-host).

### API Key

To use the API, you need to sign up on [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) and get an API key. When you sign up, you receive free credits to test the API at scale before upgrading to a paid plan.

### Features

- [**Scrape**](#scraping): scrapes a URL and get its content in LLM-ready format (markdown, summary, structured data via [json mode](#json-mode), screenshot, html)
- [**Crawl**](#crawling): scrapes all the URLs of a web page and return content in LLM-ready format
- [**Map**](/features/map): input a website and get all the website urls - extremely fast
- [**Search**](/features/search): search the web and get full content from results
- [**Extract**](/features/extract): get structured data from single page, multiple pages or entire websites with AI.

### Powerful Capabilities
- **LLM-ready formats**: markdown, summary, structured data, screenshot, HTML, links, metadata, images
- **The hard stuff**: proxies, anti-bot mechanisms, dynamic content (js-rendered), output parsing, orchestration
- **Lightning fast**: Get results in seconds—built for speed and high-throughput use cases.
- **Customizability**: exclude tags, custom headers support, max crawl depth, etc...
- **Media parsing**: pdfs, docx, images.
- **Reliability first**: designed to get the data you need - no matter how hard it is.
- **Actions**: click, scroll, input, wait and more before extracting data

You can find all of Firecrawl's capabilities and how to use them in our [documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/v2-introduction)


## Installing Firecrawl

<CodeGroup>

  <InstallationPython />

  <InstallationNode />

</CodeGroup>

## Scraping

To scrape a single URL, use the `scrape` method. It takes the URL as a parameter and returns the scraped data as a dictionary.

<CodeGroup>

  <ScrapePython />

  <ScrapeNode />

  <ScrapeCURL />

</CodeGroup>

### Response

SDKs will return the data object directly. cURL will return the payload exactly as shown below.

<ScrapeResponse />


## Crawling

The crawl feature allows you to automatically discover and extract content from a URL and all of its accessible subpages. With our SDKs, simply call the crawl method—this will submit a crawl job, wait for it to finish, and return the complete results for the entire site.



### Usage

<CodeGroup>

<CrawlPython />
<CrawlNode />
<CrawlCURL />

</CodeGroup>

If you're using our API directly, cURL or `start crawl` functions on SDKs, this will return an `ID` where you can use to check the status of the crawl.

<CrawlAsyncOutput />

### Get Crawl Status

Used to check the status of a crawl job and get its result.

<CodeGroup>

<GetCrawlJobPython />
<GetCrawlJobNode />
<GetCrawlJobCURL />

</CodeGroup>

#### Response

The response will be different depending on the status of the crawl. For not completed or large responses exceeding 10MB, a `next` URL parameter is provided. You must request this URL to retrieve the next 10MB of data. If the `next` parameter is absent, it indicates the end of the crawl data.

<CodeGroup>
  <GetCrawlJobOutputScraping />
  <GetCrawlJobOutputCompleted />
</CodeGroup>


## JSON mode

With JSON mode, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support pydantic schemas to make it easier for you too. Here is how you to use it:

<CodeGroup>

<ScrapeJsonPython />
<ScrapeJsonNode />
<ScrapeJsonCURL />

</CodeGroup>

Output:

<ScrapeJsonOutput />


## Search

Firecrawl's search API allows you to perform web searches and optionally scrape the search results in one operation.

- Choose specific output formats (markdown, HTML, links, screenshots)
- Choose specific sources (web, news, images)
- Search the web with customizable parameters (location, etc.)

For details, see the [Search Endpoint API Reference](/api-reference/endpoint/search).

<CodeGroup>

<SearchPython />
<SearchNode />
<SearchCURL />

</CodeGroup>

### Response

SDKs will return the data object directly. cURL will return the complete payload.

<SearchResponse />


### Extracting without schema

You can now extract without a schema by just passing a `prompt` to the endpoint. The llm chooses the structure of the data.

<CodeGroup>
  <ScrapeJsonNoSchemaPython />
  <ScrapeJsonNoSchemaNode />
  <ScrapeJsonNoSchemaCURL />
</CodeGroup>

Output:

<ScrapeJsonNoSchemaOutput />

## Interacting with the page with Actions

Firecrawl allows you to perform various actions on a web page before scraping its content. This is particularly useful for interacting with dynamic content, navigating through pages, or accessing content that requires user interaction.

Here is an example of how to use actions to navigate to google.com, search for Firecrawl, click on the first result, and take a screenshot.

It is important to almost always use the `wait` action before/after executing other actions to give enough time for the page to load.

### Example

<CodeGroup>

<ScrapeActionsPython />
<ScrapeActionsNode /> 
<ScrapeActionsCURL />

</CodeGroup>

### Output

<CodeGroup>

<ScrapeActionsOutput />

</CodeGroup>

## Open Source vs Cloud

Firecrawl is open source available under the [AGPL-3.0 license](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl/blob/main/LICENSE).

To deliver the best possible product, we offer a hosted version of Firecrawl alongside our open-source offering. The cloud solution allows us to continuously innovate and maintain a high-quality, sustainable service for all users.

Firecrawl Cloud is available at [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev) and offers a range of features that are not available in the open source version:
