## Engine selection

Scrape uses a single live engine per request (no waterfalling or multi-engine retries). Engine selection is deterministic based on environment variables:

- `FIRE_ENGINE_BETA_URL` set → `fire-engine;chrome-cdp`
- Otherwise `PLAYWRIGHT_MICROSERVICE_URL` set → `playwright`
- Otherwise → `fetch`

If the index/cache is enabled, Firecrawl still does an optional cache pre-check; on a miss it runs exactly one live engine.

## PDF and document handling

File type detection happens after the engine response using response headers/signatures (not URL extensions).

- PDFs: when `parsers` includes `pdf` (or when parsers are not specified), Firecrawl uses RunPod MU if configured; otherwise it uses the built-in parse-pdf flow. If RunPod MU is configured but fails, the scrape fails (no fallback).
- PDFs with `parsers: []` return base64 content in `markdown`.
- Documents (docx/xlsx/rtf/odt) are routed to the document converter after the engine response.

## HTML transform and Markdown conversion

HTML transform and HTML → Markdown conversion are native-only (no JS fallbacks). If the native transformer or markdown parser is unavailable or fails, the scrape returns:

- `SCRAPE_HTML_TRANSFORM_ERROR`
- `SCRAPE_MARKDOWN_CONVERSION_ERROR`

## Browser Actions

You can perform browser interactions before scraping by using the `actions` parameter. This allows you to:
- Wait for elements to load
- Click buttons or links
- Fill form fields
- Press keys
- Scroll pages
- Take screenshots
- Execute custom JavaScript
- Generate PDFs

Supported actions include `wait`, `click`, `write`, `press`, `scroll`, `screenshot`, `scrape`, `executeJavascript`, and `pdf`. For detailed documentation with examples, see the [Advanced Scraping Guide](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/advanced-scraping-guide#actions-actions).
