## Browser Actions

You can perform browser interactions before scraping by using the `actions` parameter. This allows you to:
- Wait for elements to load
- Click buttons or links
- Fill form fields
- Press keys
- Scroll pages
- Take screenshots
- Execute custom JavaScript
- Generate PDFs

Supported actions include `wait`, `click`, `write`, `press`, `scroll`, `screenshot`, `scrape`, `executeJavascript`, and `pdf`. For detailed documentation with examples, see the [Scrape documentation](/features/scrape#interacting-with-the-page-with-actions).
