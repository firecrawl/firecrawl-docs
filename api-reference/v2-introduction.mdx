## Base URL

All requests contain the following base URL:

```bash
https://api.firecrawl.dev 
```


## Authentication

For authentication, it's required to include an Authorization header. The header should contain `Bearer fc-123456789`, where `fc-123456789` represents your API Key.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer fc-123456789
```
​

## Response codes
Firecrawl employs conventional HTTP status codes to signify the outcome of your requests.

Typically, 2xx HTTP status codes denote success, 4xx codes represent failures related to the user, and 5xx codes signal infrastructure problems.

Status | Description
--- | ---
200 | Request was successful.
400 | Verify the correctness of the parameters.
401 | The API key was not provided.
402 | Payment required
404 | The requested resource could not be located.
429 | The rate limit has been surpassed.
5xx | Signifies a server error with Firecrawl.

Refer to the Error Codes section for a detailed explanation of all potential API errors.

​
## Rate limit
The Firecrawl API has a rate limit to ensure the stability and reliability of the service. The rate limit is applied to all endpoints and is based on the number of requests made within a specific time frame.

When you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a 429 response code with a `Retry-After` header indicating how many seconds to wait before retrying.

### Handling rate limits
When you encounter a 429 error, implement exponential backoff to retry your requests gracefully:

1. Read the `Retry-After` response header (value in seconds)
2. Wait for the specified duration before retrying
3. For subsequent retries, use exponential backoff: wait `initial_delay × (backoff_factor ^ retry_count)`
4. Start with an initial delay of 1 second and a backoff factor of 2 (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, etc.)

Example:
```python
import time
import requests

def make_request_with_retry(url, headers, max_retries=5):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers)
        if response.status_code != 429:
            return response

        retry_after = int(response.headers.get('Retry-After', 2 ** attempt))
        print(f"Rate limited. Waiting {retry_after} seconds...")
        time.sleep(retry_after)

    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
```
