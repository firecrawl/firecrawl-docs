## Base URL

All requests contain the following base URL:

```bash
https://api.firecrawl.dev 
```


## Authentication

For authentication, it's required to include an Authorization header. The header should contain `Bearer fc-123456789`, where `fc-123456789` represents your API Key.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer fc-123456789
```
​

## Response codes
Firecrawl employs conventional HTTP status codes to signify the outcome of your requests.

Typically, 2xx HTTP status codes denote success, 4xx codes represent failures related to the user, and 5xx codes signal infrastructure problems.

Status | Description
--- | ---
200 | Request was successful.
400 | Verify the correctness of the parameters.
401 | The API key was not provided.
402 | Payment required
404 | The requested resource could not be located.
429 | The rate limit has been surpassed.
5xx | Signifies a server error with Firecrawl.

Refer to the Error Codes section for a detailed explanation of all potential API errors.

### Firecrawl error codes (5xx)

When a 5xx error occurs, Firecrawl provides more specific error codes to clarify what went wrong.​

Error Code | Status | Description  
--- | --- | ---  
`SCRAPE_ALL_ENGINES_FAILED` | 500 | All scraping engines failed.  
`SCRAPE_SSL_ERROR` | 500 | Page SSL certificate is invalid. You can use `skipTlsVerification:true` to bypass this check.  
`SCRAPE_SITE_ERROR` | 500 | Unrecoverable site error.  
`SCRAPE_DNS_RESOLUTION_ERROR` | 500 | DNS resolution failed.  
`SCRAPE_ACTION_ERROR` | 500 | Error while performing a page action.  
`SCRAPE_PDF_PREFETCH_FAILED` | 500 | Failed to prefetch PDF.  
`SCRAPE_PDF_INSUFFICIENT_TIME_ERROR` | 500 | Not enough time to process PDF.  
`SCRAPE_PDF_ANTIBOT_ERROR` | 500 | PDF blocked by anti-bot mechanisms.  
`SCRAPE_ZDR_VIOLATION_ERROR` | 500 | Zero Data Retention conflict: occurs when `zeroDataRetention:true` but another option (e.g. `screenshot`) requires temporary storage.  
`SCRAPE_UNSUPPORTED_FILE_ERROR` | 500 | Unsupported file type or file size exceeds 10MB limit.  
`UNKNOWN_ERROR` | 500 | Generic or unexpected error.  

## Rate limit
The Firecrawl API has a rate limit to ensure the stability and reliability of the service. The rate limit is applied to all endpoints and is based on the number of requests made within a specific time frame.

When you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a 429 response code.

### Handling Rate Limits

To handle 429 errors gracefully, implement retry logic with exponential backoff. This allows your application to:
- Automatically retry failed requests after a delay
- Gradually increase delays between retries
- Avoid overwhelming the API during recovery

**See [Error Handling and Retries](/developer-guides/advanced-guides/error-handling-and-retries)** for complete implementation examples in Node.js and Python.
